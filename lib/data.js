		question: "Why we believe this is a Game-Changer?",
		answer: `There are millions of posts every second and the 
		internet keeps growing, how do you or anyone know which 
		has value? and this is where the prime value of NFT's kick in, 
		they can increase value of a post. By adding a stamp that has 
		a current value of 30ETH gives that post an unique advantage 
		from the rest of spammers. This is the direction in which NFT's 
		& digital world need to head into (excluding NFT game market).`,
		emoji: "",

		id: "i2",
		question: "How cryptostamping works?",
		answer: `cryptostamping is a system where people stamp on 
		websites, articles, posts, images, games, videos, almost anything. 
		The way you do it can be as simple as clicking 
		a button that the website/game itself embedded. 
		they can also do this through a browser plugin 
		without any need for embed too. it will be 100% authentic as it
		will check from On-Chain Details while both signing &
		displaying.`,
		emoji: "",
		image: "/images/snapshots/snapshot2.png",

	{
		id: "i3",
		question: "Is this Open-Source?",
		answer: `Yes, cryptostamping is an open source system 
		that is ownerless and decentralised. it regulates the stamping 
		rules through an ECS standard, that defines and preconfigures the 
		minting contract to follow the stamping standards. Any software like 
		plugin and embed are also publicly developed and 
		updated as a communal effort by the cryptostamping org.`,

		into the future harnessing the power of web3, 
		Cut Outs will always be looked up as the first digital stamp 
		collection. It's value & importance will only 
		increase with passing time. From the all new ECS standard 
		that defines cryptostamping, to the constant upgrades of all 
		integrations, cut outs will always bear the spearhead role

				people can differentiate themselves from the main
				stream. Hence we put in more efforts for each and every cutout's

				999. Take your shot before its too late. check cryptostamping.org
